## IDEA or PROBLEM STATEMENT
The theme for this Appsprint was microblogging and we had an approach to develop an app which can be used by anyone which is different from the 
stereotypical apps we have today.
Our app aims to provide a platform for users to submit anything which can be put down in words without the social norm of acceptance through likes or comments.
In the world where social media has become a platform where we seek acceptance and approval without which many of us feel disheartened we wanna provide a
plaform where one can submit anything without seeking approval through likes or comments which helps users to express themseleves without any constraints.
To develop this app we used tools like Figma to laydown the basic design of the app and Android Studio with Java as the coding backbone to develop the 
app with a minimalistic and user friendly interface.

### Write-up on the approach taken for UI design* (required)
---
While developing this app we had an approch to make this app as easy to understand and minimalistic as possible. We have a very basic user interface where 
there is a simple sign up process after which the user can view write up's posted by others and can themseleves post anything by simply adding a title and
writing down what they wanna express. With the post the user has added, only their username will be displayed which can be anything the user wishes thus 
protecting the privacy of the user. There is a profile section where the user can view the posts they have put up and delete any post by long pressing on the
post. We went with a very minimalistic pleasant colour approach for our app with very few colours used so that the user doesnt find anything complicated to
understand at first glance thus providing a simplistic appeal to our app. Our app doesnt have any like or comment sections so as to provide no constraints for 
a user to express themselves and put up what they want to rather than what the social world demands.
